# OverTheWire-Manager
A simple password manager for OverTheWire's Bandit wargame.

Simply paste in the password you found and allow the password manager to save it for you! Now, you can pick up back from where you left off.

Some levels do not require a password, therefore I simply enter "password found through ssh" as the password, as a reminder for myself later. The manager requires that you put a password for every level.
